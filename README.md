# Deep-Cross-Modal
Deep cross-modal face naming is an advanced approach that integrates image and text modalities for improved retrieval of news articles involving specific individuals. This method employs deep learning models to link faces detected in news images with the names mentioned in the corresponding text. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for facial recognition and natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis, the model establishes associations between the visual and textual representations of people. The goal is to accurately identify and name individuals in images, even when the names are not directly paired with the faces in the text. This cross-modal interaction enhances the efficiency and accuracy of news retrieval systems, allowing for a more robust search experience where users can retrieve articles about a person either through their name, face, or both. The approach is particularly useful in large-scale media repositories where people frequently appear in images without direct reference in the accompanying text, thereby improving the accessibility and organization of multimedia news content.
